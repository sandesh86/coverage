# coverage
Project for code coverage

I am able to get the code coverage of an input class (fully qualified name as VM argument). I have attempted Question 1 and 4. It would take more time to implement 3 and 4 as it seems very complex. Below are the instructions to run the project.

1. Main class to run is 'com.diffblue.interview.coverage.CoverageApp'
2. Pass a fully qualified name as VM argument like 'com.diffblue.interview.code.Sample'.
3. Output is now generated in the console and in the log file (same directory).
4. In coverage output lines are prefixed with Green(covered), Yellow(partially covered) and Red(not covered).
5. Code to be tested is written in package 'com.diffblue.interview.code'.
